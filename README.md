# âš¡ Power System Fault Detection

This project uses a Batched Tree Ensemble Classifier built on IBM Watson Studio to detect and classify power system faults (L-G, L-L, 3-phase, Normal) based on sensor data like voltage, current, and power load. 
The model is trained and deployed on IBM Cloud and supports real-time predictions via CSV/JSON inputs. 
It aims to help in quick and accurate fault identification to enhance grid reliability.
